# forest-diorama
Procedurally-generated forest diorama made for the [Pixeland Monthly Challenge][1], Februrary 2020.

Made with the [Unity game engine][2], using freely available assets:
- All models taken from [Kenney's Nature Kit][3].
- The water shader was made by [Pure Evil Studio][4].
- The fire and smoke effects are from [Synty's Simple FX pack][5].
- The wind shader (not really noticeable with the moving camera) was found at <https://github.com/RenanBomtempo/polygon-wind>.
